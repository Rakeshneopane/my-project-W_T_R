Explain the key differences and use cases between React's Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side
Rendering (SSR). Provide examples of scenarios where each approach is advantageous, and discuss the
challenges associated with using React in both contexts.

    Key Differences Between CSR and SSR in React

        Client-Side Rendering (CSR):

        Rendering: Happens in the browser using JavaScript.
        SEO: Can be problematic since content is dynamically rendered after the initial load.
        Use Cases: SPAs, real-time apps, content-heavy sites with minimal SEO needs.
        Advantages: Fast interactivity after initial load, reduced server load.
        Challenges: Slower initial load, SEO limitations, and reliance on JavaScript.

        Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

        Rendering: Happens on the server; fully rendered HTML is sent to the client.
        SEO: Good for SEO as content is fully rendered and ready for indexing.
        Use Cases: SEO-sensitive sites, content-heavy sites, e-commerce, news sites.
        Advantages: Faster initial load, better SEO, immediate content visibility.
        Challenges: Increased server load, slower interactivity due to hydration, more complex setup.
